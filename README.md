# Restaurant Review 
OpenClassrooms Front-End Developer path project: 'Launch your own restaurant review site'.

## Introduction
A single page application which displays restaurants near the user's location and allows the user to not only view reviews and add new ones, but also filter restaurants and add new ones.

## Technologies 
The main technologies and tools I used for this are:

- HTML 5 / CSS3
- Bootstrap 4
- Javascript
- MapBox API
- Foursquare API
